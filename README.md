## urlshortener

This URL Shortener was a dip into the water from the ocean that is databases, http requests and ReactJS. This is likely my final touch on it.

- Some highlights are:
    - Learning to migrate a previous(Sqlite3) database to a Postgres database.
    - Learning how to securely send database cridentials to the server.
    - Http requests and learning what all the methods like get, put, post, etc do.
    - Building a web server capable of serving web pages with the relevant CSS and JS.
    - Building the frontend with ReactJS
