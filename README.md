## urlshortener

This URL Shortener was a dip into the water from the ocean that is databases and http requests. This is likely my final touch on it, but I may come back and add a page to serve the shortened url instead of just putting the url on a blank page. 

- Some highlights are:
    - Getting to use databases(Sqlite3)
    - Http requests and learning what all the methods like get, put, post, etc do.
    - Building a web server capable of serving web pages with the relevant css and JS.
    - I got the chance to play around with a linux based server and deploy this program on it @ http://159.89.182.149/

- Usage:
    - Use the command <code>go run main.go</code> to run the program, or build and run the binary
    - Go to localhost:8080 in your web browser (by default)
    - Input URL to be shortened and hit submit
    - Win???
